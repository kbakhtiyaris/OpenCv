This project turns a **regular fan** into a **smart AI-powered fan**.

💡 The fan automatically turns **ON** when a person is detected in front of the camera, and turns **OFF** when nobody is present.

It combines:

* **OpenCV** (for real-time person detection via webcam or IP camera)
* **Flask + SQLite** (backend server to hold the fan state: `"on"` / `"off"`)
* **ESP32 + Relay Module** (to physically switch DC power of the fan)

---

## 🔧 Features

* Detects people using **OpenCV DNN** (TensorFlow frozen graph).
* Exposes a **REST API** with Flask to share the desired fan state.
* Stores logs of detections in **SQLite** for later analysis.
* ESP32 polls the Flask API and switches the **relay** accordingly.
* Safe DC wiring with optocoupler relay isolation.

## 🖥️ System Architecture

```
[Webcam/IP Camera] ---> [Ubuntu + OpenCV + Flask + SQLite] ---> [REST API]
                                                                |
                                                                v
                                                       [ESP32 + Relay] ---> [Fan ON/OFF]
```

---

## ⚡ Hardware Required

* ESP32 board (3.3V logic)
* 5V Relay Module 
* DC Fan (DC 5V / 10V depending on Fan type)
* Jumper wires + breadboard / terminal block
* USB power adapter for ESP32
* Optional: Fuse + insulated junction box (for safety)

## 📥 Model Download

The pre-trained TensorFlow model `frozen_inference_graph.pb` is too large for GitHub.

👉 **Download it manually here**:
[TensorFlow Model Zoo - SSD MobileNet V3](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.tar.gz)

Steps:

1. Download and extract the archive.
2. Copy `frozen_inference_graph.pb` into the same folder.

   ```
   /smart-fan/models/frozen_inference_graph.pb
   ```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Ubuntu / Linux (Server side)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fan.git
cd fan

# Create venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Flask + Detection:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server runs at: `http://<your-ubuntu-ip>:8080`

---

### 2. ESP32 (Firmware)

1. Open `esp32_fan_control.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Update your **Wi-Fi SSID and password** in the code.
3. Update your **serverBase** IP to match the Ubuntu machine.
4. Upload to ESP32.

---

### 3. Wiring (Relay + Fan)

```
 WALL AC            RELAY               FAN
  (220V)          +-------+           +------+
   L  ----------->| COM   |----NO---->|  L   |
   N  ------------------------------->|  N   |
   E  ------------------------------->|  E   |
                 +-------+
                 |  IN   | <--- GPIO (ESP32)
                 | VCC   | <--- 5V
                 | GND   | <--- GND
                 +-------+
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Mains AC is dangerous.

* Always enclose relay + wiring in an insulated box.
* Use a fuse for extra protection.
* Never touch AC lines directly.

---

## 🧪 Testing

1. Start the Flask server.
2. Place a person in front of the camera.
3. Check API endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl http://<your-ubuntu-ip>:8080/api/desired_state
   ```

   Should return:

   ```json
   { "desired": "on" }
   ```
4. ESP32 polls this API and switches relay accordingly.

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

* Add a web dashboard to view detection logs.
* Support multiple fans/devices.
* Use MQTT instead of REST API for faster communication.
* Add mobile app notifications.

👉 That’s a professional README. It looks like a **real-world IoT + AI project** and it will make recruiters take you very seriously.

Do you want me to also prepare the **requirements.txt** file (Flask, OpenCV, SQLite, etc.) so your repo is plug-and-play?
